According to CITE1, it is important to think about the ethical implications of dealing with data that came from atrocities. An parallel can be drawn from the slave trade discussed in that article as with the analysis of deaths of people at the Auschwitz camp. It is important when considering a dataset to think about the validity and accuracy of the data. These questions can be difficult to ask when dealing with a sensitive topic like this. Imagine telling someone that the document listing their ancestor as a victim of a heinous crime was not correct. 


How does a data scientist approach these topics with sensitivity and without losing the meaning of the event? The mere fact that this data is available speaks to the way in which the people at Auschwitz camp were treated. They were seen as a number, a statistic and not a human being. This is of huge concern as were the slaves according to CITE1. As such we must be very careful when analyzing such data as to not diminish the historic meaning of these people's lives. There are these ethical considerations that must be made
